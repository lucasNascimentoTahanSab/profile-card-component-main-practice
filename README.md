## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a lot from display flexbox in this challenge. I know I haven't used this too much in this one, but I've done a lot of research about it those days and this challenge helped me putting it in practice, so that was worth it. Along side with that, I learned some more things about position on the page and hiearchy in HTML and CSS, so that's another great point about it! I highly recommend it for the freshmen in web development, such as myself.

### Continued development

I still don't feel very confortable with absolute and relative positions as I thought I were, so that's a good thing to keep an eye on and to pratice and study more about in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) really helped me to take measures and study the original example with more details.
